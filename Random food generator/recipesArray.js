        description: "This side dish is made of just four humble ingredients — potatoes, dill, garlic, and sunflower oil — but their combination is magical. With each bite of creamy boiled potato you get a grassy hit of fresh dill and a kick from raw garlic, all brought together by the nutty aroma of virgin sunflower oil (the hallmark ingredient of Ukrainian cooking). We would eat them for breakfast alongside pickled herring, sprats, or salty smoked mackerel (a killer combination I’d take over Eggs Benedict any day), but also for dinner with chicken cutlets or fried fish.",
